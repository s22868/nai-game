This script uses a Decision Tree Classifier to classify wine samples based on their alcohol and malic_acid content.

The dataset used is the wine dataset from scikit-learn, containing samples from three different classes.

The Decision Tree model is trained and evaluated on both the training and test sets. Classification reports are printed for both sets.
