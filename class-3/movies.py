This script provides a function to suggest movies for a given user based on their similarity to other users.

The dataset used in this script is a dictionary of dictionaries containing movie ratings of users.
The dataset is stored in a JSON file and loaded into a Python dictionary using the json module.

The similarity between two users is calculated using the Euclidean distance algorithm.

The script generates a list of 5 movies that are recommended to the user and a list of 5 movies that are not recommended to the user.
